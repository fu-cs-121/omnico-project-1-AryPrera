# Omnico Project 1 Evaluation for Aranthxa Prera

### Code Functionality and Output

- Your `main.py` script successfully reads the CSV file, computes the total and average happiness ratings as well as session durations for each algorithm, and then outputs the results in the required format. The final output exactly matches the expected sample:
  - Average Happiness Rating per Algorithm: JoyStream (8.50), SerenityFlow (7.00), DeepPulse (5.00)
  - Total Number of Sessions per Algorithm: JoyStream (4), SerenityFlow (3), DeepPulse (3)
  - Average Session Duration per Algorithm: JoyStream (37.50 minutes), SerenityFlow (30.00 minutes), DeepPulse (45.00 minutes)
  - Highest Average Happiness Rating identified as JoyStream and Longest Average Session Duration identified as DeepPulse.

### Report Content and Structure

- Your report in `report.md` clearly outlines the introduction, methodology, results, observations, and conclusions. You explain how the data was processed and describe the key insights:
  - JoyStream leads with the highest happiness rating.
  - DeepPulse, despite having the longest average session duration, shows the lowest happiness rating.
- The conclusions and recommendations demonstrate that you understand the implications of the calculated statistics.

### Code Structure and Organization

- Your code is logically organized into several steps: reading the file, processing each record, updating statistics in a dictionary, and finally calculating averages and determining the top performers.
- While you used multiple loops to count sessions, sum durations, and add up happiness ratings, this approach clearly shows your understanding of iterating over lists and updating data structures.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- To further streamline your script, you might consider consolidating the multiple loops into a single loop. This would calculate the session count, total duration, and total happiness in one pass. For example:

  ```python
  with open('euphoria_data.csv', 'r') as file:
      header = file.readline()  # Skip header
      for line in file:
          clean_line = line.strip()
          columns = clean_line.split(',')
          algorithm = columns[1]
          session_duration = int(columns[2])
          happiness = int(columns[3])

          if algorithm in stats:
              stats[algorithm]['session_count'] += 1
              stats[algorithm]['total_duration'] += session_duration
              stats[algorithm]['total_happiness'] += happiness
  ```

- This approach simplifies the code and makes it easier to maintain without changing its functionality. However, your current version fulfills all the project requirements.

### Overall Feedback

- Aranthxa, your submission meets all the requirements of the project. Both your code and report effectively demonstrate your ability to read CSV data, process it, and derive meaningful insights. Your work is professional and precisely follows the assignment instructions.
