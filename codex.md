## 1. Reading and Writing Files

### Reading Files

To process data stored in files, you'll need to read the file content into your program.

**Example: Reading a file line by line**

```python
# Open the file in read mode
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Iterate over each line in the file
    for line in file:
        # Process the line
        print(line)
```

- **Note:** Using `with open()` ensures the file is properly closed after its contents have been processed.

### Skipping Header Rows

When reading CSV files, you might need to skip the header row.

**Example: Skipping the header**

```python
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Read the header line
    header = file.readline()
    # Process the remaining lines
    for line in file:
        # Process the line
        print(line)
```

### Reading and Processing CSV Files

Often, data is stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. You can read and process CSV files by splitting each line into fields.

**Example: Reading a CSV file and processing data**

```python
# Open the CSV file
with open('employees.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Read and discard the header line
    header = file.readline()
    # Process each line in the file
    for line in file:
        # Remove leading/trailing whitespace characters (including newline)
        line = line.strip()
        # Split the line into a list of values based on commas
        fields = line.split(',')
        # Access individual fields
        employee_id = fields[0]
        name = fields[1]
        department = fields[2]
        salary = fields[3]
        # Output the processed data
        print(f"ID: {employee_id}, Name: {name}, Department: {department}, Salary: {salary}")
```

**Sample `employees.csv` content:**

```
EmployeeID,Name,Department,Salary
E001,Alice Smith,Sales,75000
E002,Bob Johnson,Engineering,82000
E003,Charlie Lee,Marketing,68000
```

**Output of the code:**

```
ID: E001, Name: Alice Smith, Department: Sales, Salary: 75000
ID: E002, Name: Bob Johnson, Department: Engineering, Salary: 82000
ID: E003, Name: Charlie Lee, Department: Marketing, Salary: 68000
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `line.strip()` removes any leading/trailing whitespace, including newline characters.
  - `fields = line.split(',')` splits the line into a list of values.
  - `fields[0]` accesses the first element in the list (EmployeeID).
  - `fields[1:]` accesses elements from index 1 to the end (Name, Department, Salary).

### Slicing Lists

You can access specific parts of a list using slicing.

**Example: Accessing parts of a list**

```python
fields = ['E001', 'Alice Smith', 'Sales', '75000']

# Access the first field
employee_id = fields[0]  # 'E001'

# Access all fields except the first
other_fields = fields[1:]  # ['Alice Smith', 'Sales', '75000']
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `fields[0]` retrieves the first item in the list.
  - `fields[1:]` slices the list from index 1 to the end.

### Writing Files

To output data or results to a file, you can write to a file using the following pattern:

**Example: Writing data to a file**

```python
# Open the file in write mode
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    # Write data to the file
    file.write('Hello, OmniCo!\n')
    file.write('Data analysis complete.')
```

---

## 2. String Manipulation

### Stripping Whitespace

When reading lines from a file, you may need to remove extra whitespace characters like newline (`\n`).

**Example: Removing trailing whitespace**

```python
line = line.strip()
```

### Splitting Strings

To break a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter (e.g., commas in a CSV file), use the `split()` method.

**Example: Splitting a comma-separated string**

```python
data = 'apple,banana,cherry'
fruits = data.split(',')  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### Converting Strings to Numbers

Data read from files is often in string format. To perform calculations, convert strings to integers or floats.

**Example: Converting strings to numeric types**

```python
number_str = '42'
number_int = int(number_str)      # 42 as an integer
number_float = float(number_str)  # 42.0 as a float
```

---

## 3. Working with Data Structures

### Lists

A list is an ordered collection of items.

**Example: Creating and accessing a list**

```python
# Create a list of departments
departments = ['Sales', 'Engineering', 'Marketing', 'HR']

# Access the first department
first_department = departments[0]  # 'Sales'

# Access departments from index 1 to the end
remaining_departments = departments[1:]  # ['Engineering', 'Marketing', 'HR']
```

### Sorting Lists

You can sort lists in ascending or descending order using the `sort()` method or the `sorted()` function.

**Example: Sorting a list of numbers**

```python
# List of numbers
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]

# Sort the list in ascending order
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]

# Alternatively, using sorted()
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)  # [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

**Example: Sorting a list of strings**

```python
# List of department names
departments = ['Sales', 'Engineering', 'Marketing', 'HR']

# Sort the list alphabetically
departments.sort()
print(departments)  # ['Engineering', 'HR', 'Marketing', 'Sales']
```

**Sorting in Descending Order**

Use the `reverse=True` parameter to sort in descending order.

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)  # [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]
```

### Dictionaries

A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs.

**Example: Creating and using a dictionary**

```python
# Create a dictionary of employee IDs and names
employees = {
    'E001': 'Alice Smith',
    'E002': 'Bob Johnson',
    'E003': 'Charlie Lee'
}

# Access a value by key
employee_name = employees['E001']  # 'Alice Smith'
```

### Sorting Dictionaries

By default, dictionaries in Python 3.7+ maintain insertion order. If you want to get sorted keys or values from a dictionary, you can create a sorted list.

**Example: Sorting dictionary keys**

```python
# Get a list of sorted employee IDs
sorted_employee_ids = sorted(employees.keys())
print(sorted_employee_ids)  # ['E001', 'E002', 'E003']
```

**Example: Sorting dictionary values**

```python
# Get a list of sorted employee names
sorted_employee_names = sorted(employees.values())
print(sorted_employee_names)  # ['Alice Smith', 'Bob Johnson', 'Charlie Lee']
```

### Nested Dictionaries

Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries as values.

**Example: Nested dictionary**

```python
# Create a dictionary of employees with their details
employees = {
    'E001': {'name': 'Alice Smith', 'department': 'Sales', 'salary': 75000},
    'E002': {'name': 'Bob Johnson', 'department': 'Engineering', 'salary': 82000},
    'E003': {'name': 'Charlie Lee', 'department': 'Marketing', 'salary': 68000}
}

# Access nested values
alice_department = employees['E001']['department']  # 'Sales'
```

### Sorting a List of Dictionaries by a Key

If you have a list of dictionaries and want to sort it based on a specific key, you can use the `sorted()` function with a `key` parameter.

**Example: Sorting a list of dictionaries by salary**

```python
# List of employee dictionaries
employee_list = [
    {'name': 'Alice Smith', 'department': 'Sales', 'salary': 75000},
    {'name': 'Bob Johnson', 'department': 'Engineering', 'salary': 82000},
    {'name': 'Charlie Lee', 'department': 'Marketing', 'salary': 68000}
]

# Sort the list by salary in ascending order
sorted_employee_list = sorted(employee_list, key=lambda x: x['salary'])

# Print the sorted list
for employee in sorted_employee_list:
    print(f"{employee['name']}: ${employee['salary']}")
```

**Output:**

```
Charlie Lee: $68000
Alice Smith: $75000
Bob Johnson: $82000
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `sorted()` takes the list and a `key` function that tells it how to compare items.
  - `key=lambda x: x['salary']` means we sort based on the `'salary'` key in each dictionary.

**Sorting in Descending Order**

To sort the list in descending order, add `reverse=True`:

```python
# Sort the list by salary in descending order
sorted_employee_list = sorted(employee_list, key=lambda x: x['salary'], reverse=True)
```

### Updating Nested Dictionaries

You can update values within a nested dictionary by specifying the keys in sequence.

**Example: Updating a nested dictionary**

```python
# Update Bob's salary
employees['E002']['salary'] = 85000

# Add a new key-value pair to Charlie's details
employees['E003']['email'] = 'charlie.lee@omnico.com'
```

- **Note:** If the key does not exist, it will be added to the dictionary.

### Extracting Keys and Values as Lists

You can extract all the keys or values from a dictionary and convert them into a list.

**Example: Getting a list of employee IDs**

```python
# Get a list of employee IDs
employee_ids = list(employees.keys())  # ['E001', 'E002', 'E003']
```

---

## 4. Control Flow Statements

### If Statements

Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute code based on conditions.

**Example: Checking employee performance**

```python
sales = 120000

if sales >= 100000:
    print('Excellent performance')
elif sales >= 70000:
    print('Good performance')
else:
    print('Needs improvement')
```

---

## 5. Loops and Iteration

### For Loops

Use `for` loops to iterate over sequences like lists or dictionaries.

**Example: Iterating over a list**

```python
departments = ['Sales', 'Engineering', 'Marketing']

for dept in departments:
    print(dept)
```

### Iterating Over Dictionaries

When iterating over dictionaries, you can access keys and values.

**Example: Iterating over dictionary items**

```python
employees = {
    'E001': 'Alice Smith',
    'E002': 'Bob Johnson',
    'E003': 'Charlie Lee'
}

for emp_id, name in employees.items():
    print(f'ID: {emp_id}, Name: {name}')
```

### Looping Through Nested Dictionaries and Computing Values

You can loop through a nested dictionary to perform calculations and update the dictionary.

**Example: Calculating bonuses and adding them to the dictionary**

```python
# Existing nested dictionary of employees and their salaries
employees = {
    'E001': {'name': 'Alice Smith', 'department': 'Sales', 'salary': 75000},
    'E002': {'name': 'Bob Johnson', 'department': 'Engineering', 'salary': 85000},
    'E003': {'name': 'Charlie Lee', 'department': 'Marketing', 'salary': 68000}
}

# Loop through each employee to calculate bonuses
for emp_id, details in employees.items():
    salary = details['salary']
    # Calculate bonus: 10% of salary
    bonus = salary * 0.10
    # Add the bonus to the employee's details
    details['bonus'] = bonus

# The employees dictionary now includes the bonus amount
print(employees)
```

**Output:**

```python
{
    'E001': {'name': 'Alice Smith', 'department': 'Sales', 'salary': 75000, 'bonus': 7500.0},
    'E002': {'name': 'Bob Johnson', 'department': 'Engineering', 'salary': 85000, 'bonus': 8500.0},
    'E003': {'name': 'Charlie Lee', 'department': 'Marketing', 'salary': 68000, 'bonus': 6800.0}
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - For each employee, we calculated a bonus equal to 10% of their salary.
  - We added a new key `'bonus'` to each employee's dictionary.

### While Loops

Use `while` loops to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

**Example: Using a while loop**

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f'Count is {count}')
    count += 1
```

### Using Break Statements

The `break` statement exits the nearest enclosing loop.

**Example: Exiting a loop early**

```python
for number in range(10):
    if number == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when number is 5
    print(number)
```

---

## 6. Performing Calculations

### Basic Arithmetic Operations

You can perform arithmetic operations using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

**Example: Calculating the average salary**

```python
total_salary = 228000
number_of_employees = 3
average_salary = total_salary / number_of_employees  # 76000.0
```

### Using min() and max() Functions

The `min()` and `max()` functions return the smallest and largest of the input values, respectively.

**Example: Limiting salary increases**

```python
increase = 5000
max_increase = 4000
adjusted_increase = min(increase, max_increase)  # adjusted_increase is 4000
```

**Example: Ensuring a minimum bonus**

```python
bonus = 2000
min_bonus = 2500
adjusted_bonus = max(bonus, min_bonus)  # adjusted_bonus is 2500
```

### Calculating Percentage Increases

**Example: Calculating the percentage increase in sales**

```python
previous_sales = 100000
current_sales = 125000
increase = current_sales - previous_sales
percentage_increase = (increase / previous_sales) * 100  # 25.0%
```

### Avoiding Division by Zero

Always ensure the denominator is not zero before dividing.

**Example: Safe division**

```python
if number_of_employees != 0:
    average_salary = total_salary / number_of_employees
else:
    average_salary = 0  # Handle the zero division case appropriately
```

### Casting Values During Calculations

When performing calculations that result in float values, you may need to cast them to integers.

**Example: Converting a float to an integer**

```python
value = 76.75
integer_value = int(value)  # 76
```

- **Note:** Casting to `int` truncates the decimal part.

---

## 7. Formatting and Printing Output

### Using the Print Function

Display information using the `print()` function.

**Example: Printing a message**

```python
print('Welcome to OmniCo!')
```

### String Formatting

Format strings to include variables and control numeric precision.

**Example: Using f-strings**

```python
name = 'Alice'
salary = 75000

print(f'{name} has a salary of ${salary:.2f}')  # 'Alice has a salary of $75000.00'
```

- `:.2f` formats the number to two decimal places.

### Formatting Strings for Files

When writing formatted data to a file, you can use f-strings and special characters like `\n` (newline) and `\t` (tab).

**Example: Writing formatted text to a file**

```python
with open('employee_report.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Employee Report\n')
    file.write('---------------\n')
    file.write('ID\tName\t\t\tDepartment\tSalary\n')
    for emp_id, data in employees.items():
        line = f"{emp_id}\t{data['name']}\t{data['department']}\t${data['salary']}\n"
        file.write(line)
```

### Aligning Text Output

You can use formatting options to align text and numbers.

**Example: Formatting with alignment**

```python
# Left-align text and format numbers with precision
line = f"{emp_id:<5}{data['name']:<20}{data['department']:<15}${data['salary']:>10.2f}\n"
```

- `<` : Left-align within the available space.
- `>` : Right-align within the available space.
- `.2f` : Format the number with two decimal places.

---

## 8. Error Handling

### Handling Exceptions

Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle potential errors.

**Example: Handling ValueError**

```python
value = 'abc'

try:
    number = int(value)
except ValueError:
    print('Cannot convert to integer.')
```

---

## 9. Best Practices

### Writing Readable Code

- Use meaningful variable names.
- Keep code organized and properly indented.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.

### Commenting Your Code

- Add comments to explain non-obvious parts of your code.
- Keep comments concise and relevant.

**Example:**

```python
# Calculate the average salary
average_salary = total_salary / number_of_employees
```

#### Commenting Complex Logic

When implementing complex algorithms or logic, add comments to explain the steps.

**Example: Explaining a bonus calculation algorithm**

```python
# Loop through each employee to calculate bonuses
for emp_id, details in employees.items():
    salary = details['salary']
    # Calculate bonus as 10% of salary
    bonus = salary * 0.10
    # Add the bonus to the employee's details
    details['bonus'] = bonus
```

### Following Style Guidelines

- Use consistent naming conventions (`snake_case` for variables and functions).
- Avoid overly long lines; keep them under 80 characters when possible.
- Separate code into logical sections with blank lines.

---

## 10. Additional Tips

### Testing Your Code

- Regularly test your code with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.

### Debugging

- Use print statements or a debugger to trace and fix issues.

### Asking for Help

- If you're stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to a peer or mentor.

### Handling Data Carefully

- Be cautious when manipulating data to avoid unintended consequences.
- Ensure that you understand the data structure before performing operations.
